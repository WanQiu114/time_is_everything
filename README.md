# time_is_everything
Small projects that helps me with the time management, which basically records my activities when the script is running and upload to google callendar to show how long have I spent on different applications
Run test.py, and let it run, when you feel about it is time to get a rest, press CTRL+C to terminate it, it will automatically upload your activities on google callendar I will try to make it as an App.
