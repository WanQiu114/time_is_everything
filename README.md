Small projects that helps me with the time management, which basically records my activities when the script is running and upload to google callendar to show how long have I spent on different applications
You do need "credentials.json" and "token.json" which allows you to get access with google calender api

Run test.py, and let it run, when you feel about it is time to get a rest, press CTRL+C to terminate it, it will automatically upload your activities on google callendar I will try to make it as an App.
